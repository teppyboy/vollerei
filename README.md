An open-source launcher for anime games

## Why?

I've done [worthless-launcher](https://tretrauit.gitlab.io/worthless-launcher) for an open-world anime game, 
since I want to support other anime games and the launcher code is very messy, this launcher was made.

## Features

+ Nothing, I haven't written any code yet.

### Notes

This launcher tries to mimic the official launcher behaviour as much as possible but if a ban appears, I will
not be responsible for it. (*Turn-based game* have a ban wave already, see AAGL discord for more info)

## Alternatives

This launcher focuses on the API and CLI, for GUI-based launcher you may want to check out:
